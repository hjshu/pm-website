      <div class="body-paragraph">As the product manager for Typogram, I was tasked to design, test, and validate the brand personality feature, a core app feature. My responsibility was creating a user experience for the feature that enables users to choose and select brand personalities and test and validate the feature to see if it could be monetized.<br><br>I created this experience with no code tools, so we leverage/learn more about cost-effective solutions like no code while conserving our technical resources and shipping this experience faster. Ultimately, this workshop validated the brand personality feature and became a mini product serving as a fantastic lead generation tool, helping us develop relationships with potential users and partnerships.</div>

      <div class="body-paragraph">The complete mini product is a brand personality workshop kit in PDF, Google Slides, or Notion. All formats can accommodate guided, self-paced, solo, and collaboration modes, enabling users to use the workshop in various environments.<br><br>In the first section, users select seven terms they most resonated with from a list of brand personality words. Next, they narrowed down to the top five brand personalities using visual directions generated from words they had chosen from the previous steps. They can use their top five brand personalities to start designing their brands.</div><img src="images/brandpersonalityWorkshopKit.gif" loading="lazy" alt="typogram paper prototype

      <h1 class="post-heading">Product Evolution</h1>
      <div class="body-paragraph">When my team and I first discussed developing this workshop, we focused on identifying and designing UX flow for the brand personality features inside the Typogram app. We had already <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BgTomddpVDkdkcifF4BWJPFG9QHJA61qDppPNtC21wU/edit" class="writing-link writing-link-color">user tested the general flow of Typogram</a>. Now we could focus on the specifics - how can we make the brand personality a valuable feature to the users and propel them into the next step of the app? What specific interactions and flow can we include at this step, and what do they look like?<br><br>Since many assumptions about the product exist, we prioritized shipping quickly for testing. We created this workshop using three popular No-Code tools easily accessible to users in our space: PDF, Google Slides, and Notion. Now that we have sped up the product development process using No-Code, we can focus on testing and making the UX as rewarding as possible for users.<br><br>The end product featured a main flow: users sort through different cards of brand personality, and each time, they sort and choose using various methods: First, they identify based on a list of words and then narrow down based on images. Ultimately, users land on five words as visual themes/directions for their logos. Observing from our user testing session that branding is a starting point for conversation - we designed the workshop to work for solopreneurs or a team.<br><br>We then organized user testing sessions and received great feedback. The success of testing validated the flow and design of this feature. I was proud we designed and launched a fully-fledged mini-product across multiple platforms, validating the flow of our core feature in less than two month. This workshop now functions as a fantastic <a href="https://typogram.co/workshop/" class="writing-link writing-link-color">lead generation tool</a>, giving our primary tool, Typogram, growth and traffic.</div><img src="images/brandPersonalityWorkshopGoogle.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 84vw, (max-width: 1279px) 79vw, (max-width: 1439px) 81vw, 1164.786865234375px" srcset="images/brandPersonalityWorkshopGoogle-p-500.png 500w, images/brandPersonalityWorkshopGoogle-p-800.png 800w, images/brandPersonalityWorkshopGoogle-p-1080.png 1080w, images/brandPersonalityWorkshopGoogle.png 1440w" alt="brand personality workshop detail
